# Monty's Archive

## Site Features
- **Filterable timeline grid:** Category buttons (All, Vitals, Education & Career, Family, Personal Life) dynamically highlight relevant cards for quick browsing on the main archive page.
- **Expandable storytelling:** Each card links to a dedicated detail page that preserves the shared layout, typography, and navigation patterns for a consistent deep-dive experience.
- **Sticky quick navigation:** A persistent “Meet Monty” link anchors the experience and keeps key biography context within easy reach on every page.
- **Responsive design system:** Flexible CSS grid layouts and media queries adapt the timeline, biography facts, and expanded grids to small screens without sacrificing readability.
- **Accessible semantics:** Structural landmarks (header, main, footer), descriptive aria-labels, and keyboard-focusable links help screen-reader and keyboard users explore the archive.
- **Shared visual language:** Typography sourced from Google Fonts, polished card components, and unified color treatments create a cohesive brand for the Jones family archive.
- **Biography spotlight:** A dedicated bio page distills essential facts about Monty using a card-based layout that mirrors the archive’s styling.
- **Scripted interactivity:** `script.js` powers filter-button state management and ARIA-friendly focus updates to keep the interface intuitive.
