Never modify the MONTY.md file.

always back up files before you edit. do so by renaming the file adding .bak to the end(keep the og files extension but .bak always ends.) If a file has already been backed up do not override it. Instead add 1 to the end of bak. (Number represents version). store these in /backup.
