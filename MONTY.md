### Preston "Monty" Montgomery III: The Complete Archive

#### Vitals

Preston Montgomery III, better known as Monty, was born in 1955 in Boston, Massachusetts, into a dynasty already saturated with wealth, pride, and selective memory. At 70, he remains a relic of an era that refused to end. His name carries weight at all the right galas, though few remember exactly why. He is Founder & Chairman of **Montgomery Capital**, and a board member at The Metropolitan Opera, The Historical Society, and The Yacht Club—because the world always needs another Montgomery opinion.

He attends St. Bartholomew’s twice a year (Christmas and Easter), declaring it proof of faith and good breeding. He insists on the moral value of charity, though he measures generosity in tax deductions. His favorite saying: “Decorum is the final currency.”

#### Education

Monty was educated in the most literal sense of the word: **The Groton School**, then **Harvard University**, where he majored in Finance and minored in Connections. His reputation as a “visionary of networking” came from co-founding the Harvard Entrepreneurial Society—an organization that birthed no companies but several senators.

His MBA from **Harvard Business School** came with honors of the nonacademic sort. His thesis, *Ethics and the Executive Imagination*, was ghostwritten by a roommate who later became a poet laureate. Monty still cites it as his “first major publication.”

He avoided the Vietnam conflict through what he termed “strategic family negotiations,” later rebranded as “good business sense.”

#### Career

Monty’s professional saga began in the **1980s Boom**, where he styled himself a “pioneer of the Leveraged Buyout.” His genius, if one can call it that, lay in buying dying companies, firing the workers, and selling the bones for record profit. He once fired a vice president for using plastic cutlery in the boardroom. “Morale must be curated,” he explained.

In **1983**, he made his first famous blunder—the **Art Market Adventure**—when he purchased what he believed to be a lost Monet, only to discover it was a restaurant mural of a lake. Undeterred, he renamed it *After Monet (Interpretive Period)* and declared it “a social commentary.”

By **1992**, Monty reinvented himself as a philanthropist with the **Charity Safari**, a luxury wildlife fundraiser in Kenya where guests enjoyed air-conditioned champagne. Only one zebra benefitted: *Montgomery*, who continues to confuse conservationists to this day.

His brief foray into technology came with **AskMonty.com (2001)**, a website offering “personalized financial wisdom from the elite.” It crashed within a week when the first users began asking for jobs. Monty declared the shutdown “proof that the market wasn’t visionary enough.”

In **2006**, his memoir *Capital with Compassion* made headlines when he called minimum wage “a polite fiction.” His publisher printed that line on the cover as “provocative insight.”

He officially retired in the 2010s but remains what he calls a “strategic overseer”—code for meddling without accountability.

#### Family

**Spouse:** Muffy (née Livingston-Peabody), a Newport aristocrat whose family has possessed the same shoreline estate since the 1800s. She describes their marriage as “mutually tax-efficient.”

**Children:**

* **Preston IV (“P-Money” or “Quad”):** An influencer whose social media combines vintage suits and tone-deaf captions. His most viral post read: “Building generational wealth—emotionally.”
* **Tiffany Montgomery-Blythe:** Founder of the NGO *Wings of the Forgotten*, devoted to “ethically relocating endangered moth species.” Her board meetings feature themed cocktails.
* **Gloria (“Baby Gloria”):** The late-in-life child and unofficial brand ambassador for the Montgomery line. Appeared in *Town & Country* at age seven for “Best Dressed Under Ten.”

**Extended Lineage:**

* **Eleanor Montgomery (née Cabot):** The matriarch, age 90+. Hosts “intimate” dinners for 120. Writes passive-aggressive thank-you notes that are now considered family heirlooms.
* **Preston II:** The father and empire builder who made his fortune acquiring companies already successful and taking credit. Died surrounded by stock tickers.
* **Caroline Montgomery-Fairfield:** Monty’s sister. Philanthropic painter whose art foundation exists primarily to exhibit her own work. Yacht: *Philanthropy*.
* **Uncle Bradford (“Brad”):** The only Montgomery to ever hold a real job. Runs a vineyard. Considered scandalous for voting progressively.

#### Personal Life

**The Debutante Duel (1974):** Proposed to two debutantes at once—one in person, one by telegram. Caused a minor lawsuit and a local waltz ban.

**The Harvard Episode (Late 1970s):** Claimed to have “invented synergy.” No one has proven otherwise.

**The Art Market Adventure (1983):** See above; he still insists it was “performance art before the term existed.”

**The Charity Safari (1992):** His most expensive vacation masquerading as altruism.

**The Memoir Tour (2006):** Infamously described minimum wage as “a polite fiction.” Still quoted by think tanks who misunderstood the satire.

**The Newport Incident (2015):** Mistook the mayor’s wife for a waitress at a gala. Offered her a tip for “refilling the caviar.”

**The Digital Revival (2020s):** Attempted to digitize the family archives. Accidentally published decades of private correspondence and incriminating ledgers. The project remains online with a disclaimer: *Some entries may be dramatized.*

**Philosophy:** Monty maintains that he is not old-fashioned, merely “timeless.” In reality, he is a monument to inherited confidence and curated oblivion.
